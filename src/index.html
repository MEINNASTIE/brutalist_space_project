        <h1>Why Brutalism</h1>
        <p>Brutalism in web design is a design style that is characterized by its unconventional, raw, and unpolished appearance. It often intentionally rejects the principles of traditional web design, such as aesthetically pleasing layouts and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        <p>This webpage serves as a playground to such. Elements are playfully placed around the webpage to invoke deliberate search for purpose. Diagrams were taken to honor a small tribute to <span class="dashed">Apollo mission.</span></p>
        <h4>All diagrams provided were an open free source taken from NASA archives</h4>

        <p class="marquee-text">The cosmos is within us. We are made of stardust. We are a way for the universe to know itself. This quote by Carl Sagan beautifully captures the idea that the elements that make up our bodies and the Earth were formed in the hearts of stars, and through our exploration of space, we gain a deeper understanding of the cosmos itself.</p>
